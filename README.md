# Forest-Fire-Data-Analysis
This project seeks to create a ssummary tibble that counts the number of fires that appears in each month. Then, we'll be able to use this tibble in a visualization. We can consider `month` and `day` to be different grouping variables, so our code to produce the tibbles and plots will look similar
